# IntroCS_Project_1
GitRepo for the "Introduction to Complex Systems" course @ Utrecht University - Fall 2019


Hi all! This is just a README file to get oriented into the repository: as we create new codes, file o want to have a
  stable and safe place were to store idea/data, just add a file to this repository with a description line so we can all
  be sure to be on the same page.

Schedule of things done/to be done can be found in the "Wiki" section: it could be useful to use it as a lab journal (if needed)

Have fun!
