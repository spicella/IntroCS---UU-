Sergio:
  - Useful to investigate characteristic stabilization of the densities over time
  - Analyze the evolution of the 1D Fourier Transform of the lattice over time to detect how a structure (and what structure)
      emerges over time, if there are any spatial modes dominating..
  - Analyze a 2D Fourier transform: if no pattern arise in the simulation, this should result in a nothing but a noise figure
      otherwise the spatial frequencies of the characteristic pattern for each rule should be visible
